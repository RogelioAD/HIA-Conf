        LOW COST INITIATIVE
      </h3>
      <p>
        At Here I am Conference, we've implemented a low-cost initiative to
        ensure that everyone, regardless of their financial situation, can
        participate and experience the transformative power of Jesus. We
        understand that many young people may face financial barriers that
        prevent them from attending events like ours. Therefore, we have taken
        deliberate steps to keep our conference affordable without compromising
        on quality or impact.

        OUR WHY
      </h3>
      <p>
        We are about honoring God, obeying His call, and experiencing the
        fullness of life found in Him. We come together annually, not out of
        tradition, but out of a burning passion to draw near to the heart of
        God, to be transformed by His presence. This week is more than just a
        gathering; itâ€™s an encounter with Jesus.
